Conclusion ---\n","Based on the data from 2013Q1 to 2024Q3, the Pearson correlation coefficient between FPT's P/E ratio and its market capitalization in the subsequent quarter is 0.9098.\n","This strong, positive correlation is statistically significant (p=0.0000), suggesting that quarters with higher P/E ratios tend to be followed by quarters with higher market capitalization, and vice-versa.\n","\n","Important Considerations:\n","- Market Capitalization is used as a proxy for stock price trend.\n","- Correlation does not imply causation. Other factors heavily influence stock prices.\n","- The analysis assumes a linear relationship. Non-linear relationships might exist.\n","- Outliers can influence correlation results.
